# Newark Airport Airline Performance

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary files for my Udacity Data Scientist Lesson 1 submission.  The objective for this project was to utilize the CRISP-DM process to understand, analyze, and model a selected dataset.  Because I am preparing to travel for during the Thanksgiving weekend, I am interested in determining the probability of my flight being cancelled or delayed.  

## Description of Dataset
For this project, I downloaded airline flight data from the U.S. Dept of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics website (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=237).  The files I downloaded are contained in the .zip file on this repository.
  1) 12 monthly data files containing all flights for a calendar month
  2) airline lookup file containing the relationship between airline code and airline name
  3) source data profile containing a description of each field in the monthly data files
